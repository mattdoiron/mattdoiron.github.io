					<description><![CDATA[A few objects before the &quot;Htg-SetP-Sch&quot; object there is one called &quot;ZONE CONTROL TYPE SCHEDULE&quot;. This one has capitals for the object class name (&quot;SCHEDULE:COMPACT&quot;). When I remove these caps that file loads ok for me. It is definitely a bug that caps matter at all, and I&#039;m working on it, sorry for the inconvenience!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The capitalization is generated by idfplus. The source file EquivalentLayerWindow.idf reads:
Schedule:Compact,
    Htg-SetP-Sch,            !- Name
    Temperature,             !- Schedule Type Limits Name
... etc.

1ZoneEvapCooler.idf has a schedule:compact in exactly the same style:
  Schedule:Compact,
    System Availability Schedule,  !- Name
    Any Number,              !- Schedule Type Limits Name
...
1ZoneEvapCooler.idf loads without problems. Only thing that&#039;s different are the ScheduleTypeLimits.

The idd says: &quot;Irregular object.  Does not follow the usual definition for fields.&quot;
I cannot oversee how that impacts parsing the idf-file.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi! My first thought is that it could be related to capitalization of the &quot;SCHEDULE:COMPACT&quot;. IDF+ is currently rather rigid in its reading of class names, which causes problems when things are not _exactly_ as they appear in the idd file. I have this on my list of things to fix, but it&#039;s currently annoying. Try a file without caps in the object name and let me know? I have an issue tracked for it and similar issues here: https://bitbucket.org/mattdoiron/idfplus/issue/26/handle-incorrect-syntax-in-an-idf-file]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Matt,

I tried to open /usr/local/EnergyPlus-8-3-0/ExampleFiles/EquivalentLayerWindow.idf using idfplus.
This fails and the error message is &quot;Invalid or unknown idf object: SCHEDULE:COMPACT Loading cancelled! &quot;.
Loading another example idf (I tried 1ZoneEvapCooler.idf) that also has Schedule:Compact objects completes without errors.
Any idea?]]></description>
